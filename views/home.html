          In India, for each reported rape, 30 go unreported. Women avoid reporting out of fear of dishonor or lack of access to police stations and courts. They may not want to show their face and disclose their identity to unsympathetic listeners. For Zariya, protecting a woman’s identity is paramount. Anonymity is maintained until and unless a woman chooses to speak with a care provider. Even at that stage, the woman’s identity will only be known internally and managed confidentially.

          Once you have submitted your report, you will receive a confirmation SMS/email that also informs you of enforcement organs and care providers within your vicinity. Enforcement organs: police stations and courts. Care providers: rape crisis intervention centers, counselors and socio-legal information centers. Zariya also provides a direct channel of communication with legal information. You can access legal information before or after you have submitted a report with Zariya

          We establish gateway telephonic conversations with care providers so that you feel you can trust them before you have a face-to-face meeting with them.

          Justice delayed is justice denied. In an average case, it takes courts five to ten years to reach an agreement. With Zariya, we reduce delay. Along with care providers, you can monitor your own justice progress. We provide you with tools to ensure that your legal demands and social, emotional and psychological needs are met.  
          We believe that providing a gateway to report, access, connect and track are key process elements for enacting justice in the lives of survivors of gender-based violence.
